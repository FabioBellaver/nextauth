# Next-auth
Project created to study authentication and permissions logic, running a back-end along with the application.

## Concepts

Authentication with JWT, setting AXIOS for the application, saving data and tokens in cookies, authentication with SSR, validating authentications and many other things. All learned on the **Rocketseat** platform.

### How to run the app

First, you have to clone the back-end [here](https://github.com/rocketseat-education/ignite-reactjs-auth-backend.git).

To run the server install de dependencies, type:

	$ yarn  
    	$ yarn dev

After that you can clone this repo on terminal, this way:

    $ git clone git@github.com:FabioBellaver/nextauth.git
    // install dependencies
    $ yarn
    // and run
	$ yarn dev

You can use the static data on the backend to test. :)
